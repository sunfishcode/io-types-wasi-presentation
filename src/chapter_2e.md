Programs which operate this way are independent of:
 - Network stacks
 - Filesystems
 - Case sensitivity, <small>Unicode normalization, <small>path separators, <small>the behavior of `..`, <small>how symlinks work, <small>non-Unicode filenames, <small>filename length limitations, <small>trailing whitespace, <small>...</small></small></small></small></small></small></small></small>
